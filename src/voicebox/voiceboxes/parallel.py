class VoiceboxThread(Thread, BaseVoicebox):
    """
    Allows messages to be queued and speech handled on a separate thread
    so the main thread is not blocked waiting for speech to complete.

    Example:
        >>> voicebox = Voicebox(...)            # Build voicebox like normal
        >>> voicebox = VoiceboxThread(voicebox) # Wrap voicebox in thread
        >>> voicebox.say('Hello, world!')       # Does not block; speech handled by thread
        >>> voicebox.say('How are you?')        # Does not block
        >>> # Do stuff in main thread while speech is happening...

    Args:
        voicebox:
            The voicebox instance that will be used to generate speech.
        start:
            If ``True``, go ahead and start the thread.
        queue_get_timeout:
            Seconds to wait for text to appear in the queue of things to say
            between checks of the stop flag.
        name:
            Name of the thread.
        daemon:
            Whether the thread is daemonic (i.e. dies when the main thread exits).
