Python text-to-speech library with built-in voice effects and support for multiple TTS engines.

Documentation: [voicebox.readthedocs.io](https://voicebox.readthedocs.io)

Listen to audio samples here: [Audio Samples](https://austin-bowen.github.io/voicebox/)

```python
# Example: Use gTTS with a vocoder effect to speak in a robotic voice

from voicebox import Voicebox
from voicebox.tts import gTTS
from voicebox.effects import Vocoder, Normalize

voicebox = Voicebox(
    tts=gTTS(),
    effects=[Vocoder.build(), Normalize()],
)

voicebox.say('Hello, world! How are you today?')
```

## Setup

1. `pip install voicebox-tts`
2. Install the `PortAudio` library for audio playback.
   - On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libportaudio2`
3. Install dependencies for whichever TTS engine(s) you want to use (see section below).

## Supported Text-to-Speech Engines

Classes for supported TTS engines are located in the
[`voicebox.tts.*`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/tts) modules.

### ElevenLabs [üåê](https://elevenlabs.io/)

Online TTS engine with very realistic voices and support for voice cloning.

- Class: [`voicebox.tts.ElevenLabs`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/tts/elevenlabs.py)

  1. `pip install "voicebox-tts[elevenlabs]"`
  2. Install ffmpeg or libav for `pydub` ([docs](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub#getting-ffmpeg-set-up))
  3. Get an [API key](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/authentication)
     and do one of the following:
     - Set environment variable `ELEVEN_API_KEY=<api-key>`; or
     - Set with `import elevenlabs; elevenlabs.set_api_key('<api_key>')`; or
     - Pass as parameter to class: `voicebox.tts.ElevenLabs(api_key='<api_key>')`

### eSpeak NG [üåê](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng)

Offline TTS engine with a good number of options.

- Class: [`voicebox.tts.ESpeakNG`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/tts/espeakng.py)
- Setup:
  - On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install espeak-ng`

### Google Cloud Text-to-Speech [üåê](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech)

Powerful online TTS engine offered by Google Cloud.

- Class: [`voicebox.tts.GoogleCloudTTS`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/tts/googlecloudtts.py)
- Setup: `pip install "voicebox-tts[google-cloud-tts]"`

### gTTS [üåê](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS)

Online TTS engine used by Google Translate.

- Class: [`voicebox.tts.gTTS`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/tts/gtts.py)
- Setup:
  1. `pip install "voicebox-tts[gtts]"`
  2. Install ffmpeg or libav for `pydub` ([docs](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub#getting-ffmpeg-set-up))

### Pico TTS

Very basic offline TTS engine.

- Class: [`voicebox.tts.PicoTTS`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/tts/picotts.py)
- Setup:
  - On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libttspico-utils`

## Effects

Built-in effect classes are located in the [`voicebox.effects`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/effects) module,
and can be imported like:

```python
from voicebox.effects import CoolEffect
```

Here is a non-exhaustive list of fun effects:
- [`Glitch`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/effects/glitch.py)
  creates a glitchy sound by randomly repeating small chunks of audio.
- [`RingMod`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/effects/modulation.py)
  can be used to create choppy, Doctor Who Dalek-like effects.
- [`Vocoder`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/effects/vocoder.py)
  is useful for making monotone, robotic voices.

There is also support for all the awesome audio plugins in
[Spotify's `pedalboard` library](https://spotify.github.io/pedalboard/index.html)
using the special
[`PedalboardEffect`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/effects/pedalboard.py)
wrapper, e.g.:

```python
from voicebox import Voicebox
from voicebox.effects import PedalboardEffect
import pedalboard

voicebox = Voicebox(
    effects=[
        PedalboardEffect(pedalboard.Reverb()),
        ...,
    ]
)
```

## Examples

### Minimal

```python
# PicoTTS is used to say "Hello, world!"
from voicebox import Voicebox
voicebox = Voicebox()
voicebox.say('Hello, world!')
```

### Pre-built

Some pre-built voiceboxes are available in the [`voicebox.examples`](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/tree/main/src/voicebox/examples) package.
They can be imported into your own code, and you can run them to demo:

```bash
# Voice of GLaDOS from the Portal video game series
python -m voicebox.examples.glados "optional message"

# Voice of the OOM-9 command battle droid from Star Wars: Episode I
python -m voicebox.examples.battle_droid "optional message"
```

### Advanced

```python
# Use eSpeak NG at 120 WPM and en-us voice as the TTS engine
from voicebox.tts import ESpeakConfig, ESpeakNG

tts = ESpeakNG(ESpeakConfig(speed=120, voice='en-us'))

# Add some voice effects
from voicebox.effects import Vocoder, Glitch, Normalize

effects = [
    Vocoder.build(),  # Makes a very robotic, monotone voice
    Glitch(),  # Randomly repeats small sections of audio
    Normalize(),  # Remove DC and make volume consistent
]

# Send audio to playback device, and save to speech.wav file
from voicebox.sinks import Distributor, SoundDevice, WaveFile

sink = Distributor([
    SoundDevice(),
    WaveFile('speech.wav'),
])

# Build the voicebox
from voicebox import Voicebox

voicebox = Voicebox(tts, effects, sink)

# eSpeak NG is used to say "Hello, world!" with a glitchy robot voice
voicebox.say('Hello, world!')
```

### Command Line Demo

```bash
python -m voicebox -h               # Print command help
python -m voicebox "Hello, world!"  # Basic usage
```
