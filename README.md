# voicebox

Python text-to-speech library with built-in voice effects.

## Examples

### Basic

```python
# PicoTTS is used to say "Hello, world!"
from voicebox import Voicebox
voicebox = Voicebox()
voicebox.say('Hello, world!')
```

### Advanced

```python
# Use eSpeak NG at 120 WPM and en-us voice as the TTS engine
from voicebox.tts.espeakng import ESpeakConfig, ESpeakNG
tts = ESpeakNG(ESpeakConfig(speed=120, voice='en-us'))

# Add some voice effects
from voicebox.effects.delay import Delay
from voicebox.effects.glitch import Glitch
from voicebox.effects.dc_offset import RemoveDcOffset
from voicebox.effects.normalize import Normalize
effects = [
    Delay(time=0.005, repeats=2),   # A short delay makes a phaser effect
    Glitch(),                       # Randomly repeats small sections of audio
    RemoveDcOffset(),               # Just in case
    Normalize(),                    # Make volume consistent
]

# Send audio to playback device, and save to speech.wav file
from voicebox.sinks.distributor import Distributor
from voicebox.sinks.sounddevice import SoundDevice
from voicebox.sinks.wavefile import WaveFile
sink = Distributor([
    SoundDevice(),
    WaveFile('speech.wav'),
])

# Build the voicebox
from voicebox import Voicebox
voicebox = Voicebox(tts, effects, sink)

# eSpeak NG is used to say "Hello, world!" with a phaser-y, glitched robot voice
voicebox.say('Hello, world!')
```
