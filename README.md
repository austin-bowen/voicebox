# voicebox

![python-package](https://github.com/austin-bowen/voicebox/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)

Python text-to-speech library with built-in voice effects and support for multiple TTS engines.

## Examples

Listen to audio samples here: [Audio Samples](https://austin-bowen.github.io/voicebox/)

### Basic

```python
# PicoTTS is used to say "Hello, world!"
from voicebox import Voicebox
voicebox = Voicebox()
voicebox.say('Hello, world!')
```

### Pre-built

Some pre-built voiceboxes are available in the [`voicebox.examples`](./voicebox/examples) package.
They can be imported into your own code, and you can run them to demo:

```bash
# Voice of GLaDOS from the Portal video game series
python -m voicebox.examples.glados "optional message"

# Voice of the OOM-9 command battle droid from Star Wars: Episode I
python -m voicebox.examples.battle_droid "optional message"
```

### Advanced

```python
# Use eSpeak NG at 120 WPM and en-us voice as the TTS engine
from voicebox.tts import ESpeakConfig, ESpeakNG
tts = ESpeakNG(ESpeakConfig(speed=120, voice='en-us'))

# Add some voice effects
from voicebox.effects import Vocoder, Glitch, Normalize
effects = [
    Vocoder.build(),    # Makes a very robotic, monotone voice
    Glitch(),           # Randomly repeats small sections of audio
    Normalize(),        # Remove DC and make volume consistent
]

# Send audio to playback device, and save to speech.wav file
from voicebox.sinks import Distributor, SoundDevice, WaveFile
sink = Distributor([
    SoundDevice(),
    WaveFile('speech.wav'),
])

# Build the voicebox
from voicebox import Voicebox
voicebox = Voicebox(tts, effects, sink)

# eSpeak NG is used to say "Hello, world!" with a glitchy robot voice
voicebox.say('Hello, world!')
```

### Command Line Demo

```bash
python -m voicebox -h               # Print command help
python -m voicebox "Hello, world!"  # Basic usage
```

## Effects

Built-in effect classes are located in the [`voicebox.effects`](./voicebox/effects/) module,
and can be imported like:

```python
from voicebox.effects import CoolEffect
```

Here is a non-exhaustive list of fun effects:
- [`Bitcrusher`](./voicebox/effects/distortion.py)
- [`Delay`](./voicebox/effects/delay.py)

There is also support for all the awesome audio plugins in
[Spotify's `pedalboard` library](https://spotify.github.io/pedalboard/index.html)
using the special [`PedalboardEffect`](./voicebox/effects/pedalboard.py) wrapper, e.g.:

```python
from voicebox import Voicebox
from voicebox.effects import PedalboardEffect
import pedalboard

voicebox = Voicebox(
    effects=[
        PedalboardEffect(pedalboard.Reverb()),
        ...,
    ]
)
```
